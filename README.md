# 2025_Domain-Adaptive_Semi-Supervised-Learning_for_Efficient_Rare_Glomerular_Lesion_Detection

This repository contains code used in the paper "Domain-adaptive semi-supervised learning for efficient rare glomerular lesion detection with minimal annotation." 
The repository includes code for image preparation, YOLO training, pseudo-label generation for semi-supervised learning, and residual CycleGAN-related implementations. 
All code is designed to be executed in Jupyter Notebook.
